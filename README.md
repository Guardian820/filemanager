# PHP File Manager

A good solution for managing files and folders for developers who can't access site over SSH or FTP.

![PHP File Manager](https://raw.github.com/alexantr/filemanager/master/phpfm.png)

**WARNING! Do not use this script as regular file manager in public area.
After all actions you must delete thid script from server.**

## Requirements

- PHP 5.2 or higher.
- [Zip extension](http://php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php) for zip and unzip actions.
- Fileinfo, iconv and mbstring extensions are strongly recommended.

## How to use

Download ZIP with latest version from master branch.

Copy **filemanager.php** to your website folder and open it with web browser
(e.g. http://yoursite/any_path/filemanager.php).

## Security

Default username/password: **fm_admin**/**fm_admin**

**Warning! Please set your own username and password by settings environment values
USER and PASS before use.**

To enable or disable authentication set `$use_auth` to `true` or `false`.

*For better security enable HTTP Authentication in your web server.*

## Embedding

You can include file manager in another scripts. Just define `FM_EMBED` and other necessary constants. Example:

```php
class SomeController
{
    public function actionIndex()
    {
        define('FM_EMBED', true);
        define('FM_SELF_URL', UrlHelper::currentUrl()); // must be set if URL to manager not equal PHP_SELF
        require 'path/to/filemanager.php';
    }
}
```

Supported constants:

- `FM_ROOT_PATH` - default is `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`
- `FM_ROOT_URL` - default is `'http(s)://site.domain/'`
- `FM_SELF_URL` - default is `'http(s)://site.domain/' . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`
- `FM_ICONV_INPUT_ENC` - default is `'CP1251'`
- `FM_USE_HIGHLIGHTJS` - default is `true`
- `FM_HIGHLIGHTJS_STYLE` - default is `'vs'`
- `FM_DATETIME_FORMAT` - default is `'d.m.y H:i'`

## Using as Docker

Just run 

```bash 
docker run -h example.com -v /your/files:/var/www/mount -p 80:80 smokserwis/filemanager
```
Following envs are yours to set:
* USER - default user name
* PASS - default password
* ROOT_URL - root URL where you keep your site (eg. https://example.com/ )
* FORCE_HTTPS - for these cases where you run behind a SSL proxy and don't want to see http refers. Disabled by default

Keep your files mounted as in-container volume of /var/www/mount
That hostname is important - Apache will cry otherwise

**WARNING! This will forcibly chmod -R 777 all of your files that can be viewed. My use case was to have a Web
access to Samba shares so it doesn't really matter, but it may for you!**
